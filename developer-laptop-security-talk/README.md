# Developer laptop security & CI/CD

By: Uptycs

Traditional pipieline

1. Development -> CI/CD -> Control Plane -> Data Plane

Attackers don't think in silos, we need to secure across the pipeline + correlate data together

2. Security at the developer laptop

Audit for vulnerable software packages or malicious chrome extensions
Dynamic trust scores for zero-trust access
Detect and protect against malicious behavior
